# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is the **Outseta Agent Toolkit** - a collection of skills, templates, and documentation for AI coding agents to integrate SaaS applications with Outseta (authentication, billing, CRM, customer support).

This is NOT an application codebase - it's a reference toolkit containing templates and documentation.

## Key Files to Read First

- `AGENTS.md` - Core rules for Outseta integration
- `skills/outseta/SKILL.md` - Detailed Outseta concepts and integration patterns

## Structure

- `skills/outseta/templates/` - Code snippets for React, Node.js, and HTML embeds
- `skills/outseta/references/` - Detailed guides for JWT, usage tracking, API usage

## When Working on Outseta Integrations

Refer to @AGENTS.md for core integration rules, MCP server configurations, and available templates.
